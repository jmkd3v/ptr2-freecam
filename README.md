### Requirements:
- PCSX2
- Cheat Engine

### How To Use:
tl;dr: You just NOP the addresses and then press the Execute Script button.

1. "Unlock" all addresses used below in the Addresses array.
	To do this, repeat the following steps for every address listed:
	View the address in Cheat Engine, right click on each one,
	press the "F6" key or click "Find out what writes to this address".
	If you see a popup asking to attach a debugger, click "OK" or "Yes".
	Once you have done that, check if you see anything in the white box
	on the top left. If you don't see anything, you don't need to do anything
	to that address. If you do see something, right click everything in the
	white box and click "Replace with NOP", which will cause that code to
	no longer function.
2. Configure the program in the Options array below this.
3. Run the program with the Execute Script button at the bottom of the
	Cheat Table window.
4. Done! To use the program, read the controls listed in the Controls array.
